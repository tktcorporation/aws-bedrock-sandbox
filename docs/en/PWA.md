# How to Use Like a Native App

GenU can be installed and used like a native app using PWA (Progressive Web Application) technology (of course, you can also use it directly from a browser without installation).

Since PWA operates using browser functionality, installation is done through the browser. Here's how to use it with two major browsers.

## Installation Method

### For Google Chrome

First, access the deployed web URL. When you access it, an install button will be displayed as shown in the screen below, so click it to install.

Once installation is complete, you can run GenU independently from the browser as shown below.

### For Microsoft Edge

First, access the deployed web URL. When you access it, an install button will be displayed as shown in the screen below, so click it to install.

## Uninstallation Method

Even if you uninstall the PWA, you can continue to use it by accessing it from your browser like a normal web app.

### For Google Chrome

First, open the installed PWA. Click "Uninstall Generative AI Use Cases" from the application menu in the top right to uninstall.

### For Microsoft Edge

First, open the installed PWA. Click "App settings" from the application menu in the top right to open the settings screen. Click "Uninstall" in the settings screen to uninstall.
