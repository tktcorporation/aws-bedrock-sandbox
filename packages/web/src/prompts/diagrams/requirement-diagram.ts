Syntax for writing requirement diagrams in Mermaid
Requirement diagrams have three types of components: requirements, elements, and relationships.
Below is the grammar for defining each. Words in angle brackets like <word> are enumerated keywords with options that are explained in detail in the table. user_defined_... is used where user input is expected.
Important note about user text: All inputs should be enclosed in quotes. For example, Id: "here is an example" is valid, but Id: here is an example is not.
Simple implementation example:
requirementDiagram

requirement "Test Requirement" {
id: 1
text: "Test Text"
risk: high
verifymethod: test
}

element "Test Entity" {
type: "simulation"
docref: "reference"
}

"Test Entity" - satisfies -> "Test Requirement"

Syntax:
Requirement
Requirements are defined by the type, name, ID, text, risk, and verification method. The syntax is as follows: 
<type> "user_defined_name" {
    id: "user_defined_ID"
    text: "user_defined_text"
    risk: <risk>
    verifymethod: <verification method>
}
The type, risk, and verification method are enumerated types defined in SysML.
Keyword | Option
---|---
type | requirement (requirement), functionalRequirement (functional requirement), interfaceRequirement (interface requirement), performanceRequirement (performance requirement), physicalRequirement (physical requirement), designConstraint (design constraint)
risk | Low (low), Medium (medium), High (high)
verification method | Analysis (analysis), Inspection (inspection), Test (test), Demonstration (demonstration)

Element
Elements are defined by the name, type, and document reference. All three are user-defined. Element functionality is intended to be lightweight, but requirements can be connected to other parts of documents.
element "user_defined_name" {
    type: "user_defined_type"
    docref: "user_defined_reference"
}

Relationship
Relationships are defined by the start node, end node, and relationship type.
{start node name} - <relationship type> -> {end node name}
or
{end node name} <- <relationship type> - {start node name}

"Start node name" and "End node name" must be the names of requirements or elements defined elsewhere.
The relationship type is one of the following: 
- contains
- copies
- derives
- satisfies
- verifies
- refines
- traces
Each relationship is labeled in the diagram.

Here is a larger example: 
This example uses all the features of the diagram.

"Test Entity" - satisfies -> "Test Requirement 2"
