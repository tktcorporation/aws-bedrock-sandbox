Mermaid ER diagram overview
Entity names are often written in uppercase, but there is no established standard for this, and Mermaid does not require it.
Relationships between entities are represented by lines with cardinality-indicating terminal markers. Mermaid uses the most common cardinality notation. Cardinality conveys the potential number of instances of the connected entity in an intuitive way.
ER diagrams can be used for various purposes, from abstract logical models that do not include implementation details to physical models of relational database tables. Including attribute definitions in ER diagrams can be useful to help understand the purpose and meaning of entities. These are not necessarily exhaustive and often a small subset of attributes is sufficient. Mermaid allows defining attributes as a type and name.
Code: 
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string custNumber
        string sector
    }
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        string deliveryAddress
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        string productCode
        int quantity
        float pricePerUnit
    }
When including attributes in an ER diagram, you need to decide whether to include foreign keys as attributes. This depends on how strictly you want to represent the relational table structure.

If the diagram is a logical model that does not imply a relational database implementation, it's better to omit foreign keys. This is because the relationship connections already convey how entities are related. For example, JSON data structures can implement one-to-many relationships using arrays without requiring foreign key properties. Similarly, object-oriented programming languages can use pointers or references to collections.

Even for models intended for relational database implementation, you might decide that including foreign key attributes duplicates information already depicted by relationships and doesn't add meaning to the entity. Ultimately, this is left to the designer's choice.

Syntax
Entities and Relationships
The Mermaid syntax for ER diagrams is compatible with PlantUML, with extensions for labeling relationships. Each statement consists of the following parts:
<first entity> [<relationship> <second entity> : <relationship label>]
Explanation of each part:
First entity: The name of the entity. Names must start with an alphabetical character or underscore (since v10.5.0), and can also include numbers and hyphens.
Relationship: Describes how the two entities interrelate.
Second entity: The name of the other entity.
Relationship label: A description of the relationship from the perspective of the first entity.
Example:
PROPERTY ||--|{ ROOM : contains
This statement can be read as "One property contains one or more rooms, and a room belongs to exactly one property." The label here is from the perspective of the first entity: properties contain rooms, not the other way around. The equivalent label from the second entity's perspective can usually be easily inferred.
Only the first entity part of the statement is mandatory. This allows displaying entities without relationships, which is useful when building diagrams incrementally. However, if you specify other parts of the statement, all parts become mandatory.

Relationship Syntax
The relationship part of each statement can be broken down into three sub-components:
- The cardinality of the first entity with respect to the second
- Whether the relationship confers identity on a 'child' entity
- The cardinality of the second entity with respect to the first

Cardinality is the property that describes how many elements of one entity can be linked to another entity. In the previous example, a PROPERTY can have one or more ROOM instances, while a ROOM can only be associated with one PROPERTY.
Each cardinality marker has two characters. The outer character represents the maximum value, and the inner character represents the minimum value.
Possible values of cardinality: 
Value (left)     Value (right)     Meaning
|o          o|         Zero or one
||          ||         Exactly one
}o          o{         Zero or more (no upper limit)
}|          |{         One or more (no upper limit)

Aliases: 
Value (left)     Value (right)     Meaning
one or zero     one or zero     Zero or one
zero or one     zero or one     Zero or one
one or more     one or more     One or more
one or many     one or many     One or more
many(1)         many(1)         One or more
1+              1+              One or more
zero or more    zero or more    Zero or more
zero or many    zero or many    Zero or more
many(0)         many(0)         Zero or more
0+              0+              Zero or more
only one        only one        Exactly one
1               1               Exactly one

Identification
Relationships are classified as identifying or non-identifying, and are drawn with solid lines or dashed lines respectively. This becomes important when one of the related entities cannot exist independently without the other.
For example, consider a company dealing with car driver insurance that needs to store data for NAMED-DRIVERS. When modeling this, we first notice that a CAR can be driven by many PERSON instances, a PERSON can drive many CARs, and both entities can exist independently of each other. This is a non-identifying relationship, which can be written in Mermaid as:
PERSON }|..|{ CAR : "driver"
The two dots in the center of the relationship cause the two entities to be drawn with a dashed line.
However, when decomposing this many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships, we see that a NAMED-DRIVER cannot exist without both a PERSON and a CAR. In this case, the relationship becomes identifying and is specified using hyphens, drawn with a solid line.

Aliases:
Value             Meaning
to                identifying relationship
optionally to     non-identifying relationship

Code: 
erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is

Attributes
Attributes can be defined by specifying multiple type-name pairs within a block delimited by an opening brace { and a closing brace } after the entity name. Attributes are drawn inside the entity box.
Code example:
erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    CAR {
        string registrationNumber
        string make
        string model
    }
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
    PERSON {
        string firstName
        string lastName
        int age
    }
Type values must start with an alphabetic character and can include numbers, hyphens, underscores, parentheses, and square brackets.
Name values follow the same format as types, but can also begin with an asterisk (*) to indicate a primary key.
There are no other restrictions, and there are no implicit settings for valid data types.

Entity Name Aliases
Entities can have aliases using square brackets. If an alias is provided, it will be displayed instead of the entity name in the diagram.
Code: 
erDiagram
    p[Person] {
        string firstName
        string lastName
    }
    a["Customer Account"] {
        string email
    }
    p ||--o| a : has

Attribute Keys and Comments
Attributes can have keys and comments defined. Keys include primary key (PK: Primary Key), foreign key (FK: Foreign Key), and unique key (UK: Unique Key). If an attribute has multiple key constraints, specify them with a comma (e.g., PK, FK).
Comments are defined using double quotes at the end of the attribute. Comments themselves cannot include double quotes.
Code example: 
erDiagram
    CAR ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : allows
    CAR {
        string registrationNumber PK
        string make
        string model
        string[] parts
    }
    PERSON ||--o{ NAMED-DRIVER : is
    PERSON {
        string driversLicense PK "The license #"
        string(99) firstName "Only 99 characters are allowed"
        string lastName
        string phone UK
        int age
    }
    NAMED-DRIVER {
        string carRegistrationNumber PK, FK
        string driverLicence PK, FK
    }
    MANUFACTURER only one to zero or more CAR : makes

Other Things
- If the relationship label consists of multiple words, it must be enclosed in double quotes.
- If you do not want to label a relationship, you must use an empty string enclosed in double quotes.
- If you want to label a relationship with multiple lines, use <br /> between the lines ("first line<br />second line").
