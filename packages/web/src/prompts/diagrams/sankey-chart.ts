Mermaid.js Sankey diagram notation
Basic structure
sankey-beta
Node1,Node2,Value
Node2,Node3,Value
...

Points of Sankey diagram design
Types of nodes
- Nodes are represented by comma-separated values
- The first column is the source node, the second column is the target node, and the third column is the value

Points of Sankey diagram design
- You can visually separate by inserting an empty line
- You can include commas in node names by enclosing them in double quotes
- If you need to include commas in node names, enclose them in double quotes
- If you need to include double quotes in node names, include a pair of double quotes in the quoted string
- If you need to include commas in node names, enclose them in double quotes
- If you need to include double quotes in node names, include a pair of double quotes in the quoted string
