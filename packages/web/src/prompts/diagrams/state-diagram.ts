Parallel processing is represented with --

In a state diagram, the system is described by states and transitions between states. The diagram above shows three states: Still (static), Moving (in motion), and Crash (collision). It starts in the Still (static) state. It can transition to the Moving (in motion) state. From the Moving (in motion) state, it can either return to the Still (static) state or transition to the Crash (collision) state. There is no transition from Still (static) to Crash (collision) because a static state cannot collide.
States
States can be declared in multiple ways. The simplest method is to define a state with only an id.
stateDiagram-v2
    stateId
Another method is to add a description using the state keyword: 
stateDiagram-v2
    state "This is a state description" as s2
Another method is to add a description using the state keyword: 
stateDiagram-v2
    s2 : This is a state description

Transitions
Transitions are the paths/edges between states when transitioning from one state to another. This is represented using the arrow text "-->".
When defining a transition between two states, if the state is not yet defined, the undefined state is defined using the id obtained from the transition. This method allows for adding a description to the defined state later.
stateDiagram-v2
    s1 --> s2
It is possible to add text to a transition to explain what it represents: 
stateDiagram-v2
    s1 --> s2: A transition

Start and End
There are two special states that represent the start and end of a diagram. These are written using the syntax "[*]" and are defined by the direction of the transition to it.
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> s1
    s1 --> [*]

Composite states
In practical use of state diagrams in the field, a single state may contain multiple internal states, often resulting in multi-dimensional diagrams. In this terminology, these are called composite states.
To define a composite state, you need to write the id after the state keyword and describe the body of the composite state between {}. Similar to simple states, you can name composite states on a separate line. See the example below:
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> First
    state First {
        [*] --> second
        second --> [*]
    }

    [*] --> NamedComposite
    NamedComposite: Another Composite
    state NamedComposite {
        [*] --> namedSimple
        namedSimple --> [*]
        namedSimple: Another simple
    }

You can set multiple hierarchies as follows: 
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> First

    state First {
        [*] --> Second

        state Second {
            [*] --> second
            second --> Third

            state Third {
                [*] --> third
                third --> [*]
            }
        }
    }
You can also define transitions between composite states: 
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> First
    First --> Second
    First --> Third

    state First {
        [*] --> fir
        fir --> [*]
    }
    state Second {
        [*] --> sec
        sec --> [*]
    }
    state Third {
        [*] --> thi
        thi --> [*]
    }

Choice
If you need to model a choice between two or more paths, you can use the <<choice>> keyword to achieve this.
stateDiagram-v2
    state if_state <<choice>>
    [*] --> IsPositive
    IsPositive --> if_state
    if_state --> False: if n < 0
    if_state --> True : if n >= 0

Forks
You can use the <<fork>> and <<join>> keywords to specify a fork in the diagram.
stateDiagram-v2
state fork_state <<fork>>
    [*] --> fork_state
    fork_state --> State2
    fork_state --> State3

    state join_state <<join>>
    State2 --> join_state
    State3 --> join_state
    join_state --> State4
    State4 --> [*]

Notes
Sometimes it is easier to represent with sticky notes. This is also the case with state diagrams.
You can place the note on the right or left side of the node.
stateDiagram-v2
    State1: The state with a note
    note right of State1
        Important information! You can write
        notes.
    end note
    State1 --> State2
    note left of State2 : This is the note to the left.

Concurrency
Similar to plantUML, you can use the -- symbol to specify concurrency.
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Active

    state Active {
        [*] --> NumLockOff
        NumLockOff --> NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed
        NumLockOn --> NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed
        --
        [*] --> CapsLockOff
        CapsLockOff --> CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed
        CapsLockOn --> CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed
        --
        [*] --> ScrollLockOff
        ScrollLockOff --> ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed
        ScrollLockOn --> ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed
    }

Setting the direction of the diagram
In state diagrams, you can use the direction keyword to set the direction in which the diagram is rendered.
stateDiagram
    direction LR
    [*] --> A
    A --> B
    B --> C
    state B {
      direction LR
      a --> b
    }
    B --> D

Comments
You can input comments into the state diagram chart, which are ignored by the parser. Comments must be on a separate line and must start with %% (double percent sign). The text from the start of the comment to the next line break will be treated as a comment, including the diagram syntax.
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]
%% this is a comment
    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still %% another comment
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]

Styling with classDefs
Similar to other diagrams (flowcharts, etc.), you can define styles in the diagram and apply them to one or more states in the diagram.
The classDef for state diagrams currently has the following limitations: 
- Cannot be applied to the start or end states
- Cannot be applied to composite states, nor used within composite states
Styles are defined using the classDef keyword (the "class" keyword has the same meaning as CSS classes), followed by the name of the style, and then one or more property and value pairs. Each property and value pair is followed by a colon (:), and then the value is written.
Here is an example of a classDef with one property and value pair: 
classDef movement font-style:italic;
Here,
- The name of the style is "movement"
- The only property is "font-style", and its value is "italic"
If you want to have multiple property and value pairs, you can put a comma (,) between each property and value pair.
Here is an example of a classDef with three property and value pairs: 
classDef badBadEvent fill:#f00,color:white,font-weight:bold,stroke-width:2px,stroke:yellow
Here,
- The name of the style is "badBadEvent"
- The 1st property is "fill", and its value is "#f00"
- The 2nd property is "color", and its value is "white"
- The 3rd property is "font-weight", and its value is "bold"
- The 4th property is "stroke-width", and its value is "2px"
- The 5th property is "stroke", and its value is "yellow"
Apply classDef styles to states
There are two ways to apply classDef styles to states: 
1. Use the class keyword to apply a classDef style to one or more states in a single statement
2. Use the ::: operator to apply a classDef style to a state in a transition statement (e.g., an arrow between states)
1. class statement
The class statement instructs Mermaid to apply the specified classDef to one or more states. The format is as follows: 
class [one or more state names, separated by commas] [name of a style defined with classDef]
Here is an example of applying the badBadEvent style to a state named Crash: 
class Crash badBadEvent
Here is an example of applying the movement style to two states named Moving and Crash: 
class Moving, Crash movement
Here is an actual usage example: 
stateDiagram
   direction TB

   accTitle: This is the accessible title
   accDescr: This is an accessible description

   classDef notMoving fill:white
   classDef movement font-style:italic
   classDef badBadEvent fill:#f00,color:white,font-weight:bold,stroke-width:2px,stroke:yellow

   [*]--> Still
   Still --> [*]
   Still --> Moving
   Moving --> Still
   Moving --> Crash
   Crash --> [*]

   class Still notMoving
   class Moving, Crash movement
   class Crash badBadEvent
   class end badBadEvent
2. ::: operator to apply a style to a state
The ::: operator can be used to apply a classDef style to a state. The syntax is as follows: 
[state]:::[style name]
You can use this in the diagram within a class statement. This also includes the start and end states. For example: 
stateDiagram
   direction TB

   accTitle: This is the accessible title
   accDescr: This is an accessible description

   classDef notMoving fill:white
   classDef movement font-style:italic;
   classDef badBadEvent fill:#f00,color:white,font-weight:bold,stroke-width:2px,stroke:yellow

   [*] --> Still:::notMoving
   Still --> [*]
   Still --> Moving:::movement
   Moving --> Still
   Moving --> Crash:::movement
   Crash:::badBadEvent --> [*]

Spaces in state names
States with spaces can be created by first defining the state with an id and then referencing that id.
In the following example, there is a state with an id of "yswsii" and a description of "Your state with spaces in it". After defining it, "yswsii" is used in the first transition ([*] --> yswsii) and the transition to YetAnotherState (yswsii --> YetAnotherState). (yswsii is styled to be distinguishable from other states.)
stateDiagram
    classDef yourState font-style:italic,font-weight:bold,fill:white

    yswsii: Your state with spaces in it
    [*] --> yswsii:::yourState
    [*] --> SomeOtherState
    SomeOtherState --> YetAnotherState
    yswsii --> YetAnotherState
    YetAnotherState --> [*]
