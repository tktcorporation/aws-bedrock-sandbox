Basic Syntax of Mermaid Class Diagrams
Class
UML provides a mechanism for expressing class members such as attributes and methods, along with additional information about them. A single instance of a class in a diagram contains three compartments:
The upper compartment contains the name of the class. It is centered in bold with the first letter capitalized. Optional annotation text describing the nature of the class can also be included.
The middle compartment contains the attributes of the class. They are left-aligned with the first letter in lowercase.
The lower compartment contains the operations that the class can perform. These are also left-aligned with the first letter in lowercase.

title: Bank example

classDiagram
  class BankAccount
  BankAccount : +String owner
  BankAccount : +Bigdecimal balance
  BankAccount : +deposit(amount)
  BankAccount : +withdrawal(amount)

Define a class
There are two ways to define classes:
Using the keyword "class" to explicitly define a class (e.g., writing class Animal to define an Animal class).
Defining two classes and their relationship simultaneously through relationships (e.g., Vehicle <|-- Car).
classDiagram
  class Animal
  Vehicle <|-- Car
Naming convention: Class names must consist of alphanumeric characters (including Unicode), underscores, and hyphens (-) only.

Class labels
If you need to label a class, you can use the following syntax:
classDiagram
  class Animal["Animal with a label"]
  class Car["Car with *! symbols"]
  Animal --> Car
You can also use backticks to escape special characters in labels:
classDiagram
  class \`Animal Class!\`
  class \`Car Class\`
  \`Animal Class!\` --> \`Car Class\`

Defining Members of a class
UML provides a mechanism to represent class members such as attributes and methods, along with additional information about them.
Mermaid distinguishes between attributes and functions/methods based on the presence of parentheses (). Those with () are treated as functions/methods, while everything else is treated as attributes.
There are two ways to define class members, and using either syntax to define members will result in the same output. The two different methods are:
Using : (colon) followed by the member name to associate members with a class, which is convenient when defining one member at a time. Example:
classDiagram
class BankAccount
BankAccount : +String owner
BankAccount : +BigDecimal balance
BankAccount : +deposit(amount)
BankAccount : +withdrawal(amount)

Using {} brackets to associate members with a class, grouping members within curly braces. This is suitable for defining multiple members at once. Example:
classDiagram
class BankAccount{
    +String owner
    +BigDecimal balance
    +deposit(amount)
    +withdrawal(amount)
}

Return Type
Optionally, you can specify the return data type at the end of a method/function definition (note: you need to put a space between the last parenthesis ) and the return type). Example:
classDiagram
class BankAccount{
    +String owner
    +BigDecimal balance
    +deposit(amount) bool
    +withdrawal(amount) int
}

Generic Types
Generics can be expressed as part of a class definition or as class member/return types. To indicate a type as generic, surround it with ~ (tilde). Nested type declarations like List<List<int>> are supported, but generics with commas like List<List<K, V>> are currently not supported.
Note: When generics are used in a class definition, the generic type is not considered part of the class name. This means that in syntax where you need to reference the class name, you should omit the type part of the definition. This simultaneously means that Mermaid currently does not support two classes with the same name but different generic types.
classDiagram
class Square~Shape~{
    int id
    List~int~ position
    setPoints(List~int~ points)
    getPoints() List~int~
}

Square : -List~string~ messages
Square : +setMessages(List~string~ messages)
Square : +getMessages() List~string~
Square : +getDistanceMatrix() List~List~int~~

Visibility
You can place optional notation in front of member names to describe the visibility (or encapsulation) of attributes and methods/functions that are part of a class (i.e., class members):
+ Public
- Private
# Protected
~ Package/Internal
To include additional modifiers in method definitions, you can add the following notation at the end of the method (i.e., after () or after the return type):
* Abstract method. Example: someAbstractMethod()* or someAbstractMethod() int*
$ Static method. Example: someStaticMethod()$ or someStaticMethod() String$
To include additional modifiers in field definitions, you can add the following notation at the end:
$ Static field. Example: String someField$

Defining Relationship
Relationship is a general term representing a specific logical connection found in class diagrams or object diagrams.
[ClassA][arrow][ClassB]
In UML, there are currently 8 types of supported relationships between classes:
Type          Description
<|--         Inheritance
*--          Composition
o--          Aggregation
-->          Association
--           Link (solid line)
..>          Dependency
..|>         Realization
..           Link (dashed line)

classDiagram
classA <|-- classB
classC *-- classD
classE o-- classF
classG <-- classH
classI -- classJ
classK <.. classL
classM <|.. classN
classO .. classP

You can use labels to describe the nature of the relationship between two classes. You can also use the arrow in the opposite direction: 
classDiagram
classA --|> classB : Inheritance
classC --* classD : Composition
classE --o classF : Aggregation
classG --> classH : Association
classI -- classJ : Link(Solid)
classK ..> classL : Dependency
classM ..|> classN : Realization
classO .. classP : Link(Dashed)

Labels on Relations
You can add label text to the relationship: 
[classA][Arrow][ClassB]:LabelText
classDiagram
classA <|-- classB : implements
classC *-- classD : composition
classE o-- classF : aggregation

Two-way relations
Relationships can represent logical N:M (many-to-many) associations: 
classDiagram
    Animal <|--|> Zebra

The syntax is as follows: 
[Relation Type][Link][Relation Type]
The types of relationships are as follows: 
Type     Description
<|      Inheritance
\\*     Composition
o       Aggregation
>       Association
<       Association
|>      Realization
Link is one of the following: 
Type     Description
--      Solid line
..      Dashed line

Lollipop Interfaces
Classes can also be given a special type of relationship that defines a lollipop interface. A lollipop interface is defined with the following syntax:
bar ()-- foo
foo --() bar
The interface (bar) connects to the class (foo) with a lollipop.
Note: Each interface defined is unique and is not intended to be shared between classes or connected with multiple edges.
classDiagram
  bar ()-- foo

classDiagram
  class Class01 {
    int amount
    draw()
  }
  Class01 --() bar
  Class02 --() bar

  foo ()-- Class01

Define Namespace
Namespace groups classes.
classDiagram
namespace BaseShapes {
    class Triangle
    class Rectangle {
      double width
      double height
    }
}

Cardinality / Multiplicity on relations
Multiplicity or cardinality in class diagrams indicates how many instances of one class can be linked to instances of another class. For example, each company has one or more employees (not zero), and each employee currently works for zero or one company.

Multiplicity notation is placed near the end of an association.

Cardinality options are as follows:
1     Exactly 1
0..1  0 or 1
1..*  1 or more
*     Many
n     n (where n is greater than 1)
0..n  0 to n (where n is greater than 1)
1..n  1 to n (where n is greater than 1)

Cardinality can be easily defined by placing text options enclosed in quotation marks "before and after a given arrow. Example:
[classA] "cardinality1" [Arrow] "cardinality2" [ClassB]:LabelText

classDiagram
  Customer "1" --> "*" Ticket
  Student "1" --> "1..*" Course
  Galaxy --> "many" Star : Contains

Annotations on classes
You can annotate classes with markers to provide additional metadata about the class. This allows you to more clearly indicate the nature of the class. Common annotations include:
<<Interface>> Represents an interface class
<<Abstract>> Represents an abstract class
<<Service>> Represents a service class
<<Enumeration>> Represents an enumeration type
Annotations are defined between the opening << and closing >>. There are two ways to add annotations to a class, and both methods produce the same output:

Write on a separate line after the class is defined:
classDiagram
class Shape
<<interface>> Shape
Shape : noOfVertices
Shape : draw()

Describe with nested structure along with class definition:
classDiagram
class Shape{
    <<interface>>
    noOfVertices
    draw()
}
class Color{
    <<enumeration>>
    RED
    BLUE
    GREEN
    WHITE
    BLACK
}

Comments
Comments can be included in class diagrams, which are ignored by the parser. Comments must be on separate lines and must start with %% (double percent sign). All text, including class diagram syntax, until the next line break is treated as a comment.
classDiagram
%% This whole line is a comment classDiagram class Shape <<interface>>
class Shape{
    <<interface>>
    noOfVertices
    draw()
}

Setting the direction of the diagram
Class diagrams can be set to draw in a specific direction using the direction keyword: 
classDiagram
  direction RL
  class Student {
    -idCard : IdCard
  }
  class IdCard{
    -id : int
    -name : string
  }
  class Bike{
    -id : int
    -name : string
  }
  Student "1" --o "1" IdCard : carries
  Student "1" --o "1" Bike : rides

Interaction
Nodes can be bound to click events. Clicks can be linked to either a JavaScript callback or a link that opens in a new browser tab. Note: This feature is disabled when using securityLevel='strict', and enabled when using securityLevel='loose'.
These actions are defined on a separate line after all classes have been declared.
action className "reference" "tooltip"
click className call callback() "tooltip"
click className href "URL" "tooltip"

action is one of the following: link or callback
className is the ID of the node the action is associated with
reference is the URL link or callback function name
(optional) tooltip is the string that appears when hovering over the element
Note: The tooltip style is set with class .mermaidTooltip
Note: The callback function is called with nodeId as a parameter.

Notes
You can add notes to the diagram using "note "line1\nline2"". You can also add notes to specific classes using "note for <className> "line1\nline2"".
classDiagram
  note "This is a general note"
  note for MyClass "This is a note for a class"
  class MyClass{
  }

URL Link:
classDiagram
class Shape
link Shape "https://www.github.com" "This is a tooltip for a link"
class Shape2
click Shape2 href "https://www.github.com" "This is a tooltip for a link"

Callback:
classDiagram
class Shape
callback Shape "callbackFunction" "This is a tooltip for a callback"
class Shape2
click Shape2 call callbackFunction() "This is a tooltip for a callback"

classDiagram
  class Class01
  class Class02
  callback Class01 "callbackFunction" "Callback tooltip"
  link Class02 "https://www.github.com" "This is a link"
  class Class03
  class Class04
  click Class03 call callbackFunction() "Callback tooltip"
  click Class04 href "https://www.github.com" "This is a link"

Styling
Styling a node
You can use the style keyword to apply specific styles to individual nodes, such as a thick border or a different background color.
However, notes and namespaces cannot be styled individually, but they support themes.
classDiagram
  class Animal
  class Mineral
  style Animal fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px
  style Mineral fill:#bbf,stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
Classes
It is more convenient to define a style class and apply it to nodes that should have a different appearance.

The class definition is as follows: 
classDef className fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
You can also define multiple classes in one statement: 
classDef className1,className2 font-size:12pt;
You can apply the class to nodes as follows: 
cssClass "nodeID1" className;
You can also apply the class to multiple nodes in one statement: 
cssClass "nodeID1,nodeID2" className;
As a shorter form to add a class, you can use the ::: operator to apply the class name to a node: 
classDiagram
  class Animal:::someclass
  classDef someclass fill:#f96

Or
classDiagram
  class Animal:::someclass {
      -int sizeInFeet
      -canEat()
  }
  classDef someclass fill:#f96

Default class
If the class name is default, it will be applied to all nodes. To override the applied default style, you need to define a specific style or class after that.
classDef default fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
classDiagram
  class Animal:::pink
  class Mineral

  classDef default fill:#f96,color:red
  classDef pink color:#f9f

Configuration
Members Box
You can hide the empty member box of a class node.
This can be achieved by changing the value of hideEmptyMembersBox in the class diagram settings. For more details on how to edit the Mermaid settings, please refer to the settings page.

  config:
    class:
      hideEmptyMembersBox: true
