Mermaid network packet diagram notation
Basic structure:
packet-beta
title [Packet Name]
0-15: "[Field Name]"
16-31: "[Field Name]"
...

Points:
- Start with packet-beta, define fields with a title and bit range
- The bit range starts at 0, and the field description is enclosed in quotes
- Multiple fields can be defined
- For variable-length fields, leave the last range blank

Example:
This type of diagram is particularly useful for developers, network engineers, educators, and students who need to clearly and concisely represent the structure of network packets.

Syntax:
packet-beta
start: "Block Name" %% Single bit block
start-end: "Block Name" %% Multiple bit block
... other fields ...

Detailed syntax:
Range: Each line after the title represents a different field in the packet. The range (e.g., 0-15) indicates the bit position within the packet.
Field description: A brief description of what the field represents, enclosed in quotes.

Implementation example 1:
packet-beta
title TCP Packet
0-15: "Source Port"
16-31: "Destination Port"
32-63: "Sequence Number"
64-95: "Acknowledgment Number"
96-99: "Data Offset"
100-105: "Reserved"
106: "URG"
107: "ACK"
108: "PSH"
109: "RST"
110: "SYN"
111: "FIN"
112-127: "Window"
128-143: "Checksum"
144-159: "Urgent Pointer"
160-191: "(Options and Padding)"
192-255: "Data (variable length)"

Implementation example 2:
packet-beta
title UDP Packet
0-15: "Source Port"
16-31: "Destination Port"
32-47: "Length"
48-63: "Checksum"
64-95: "Data (variable length)"
