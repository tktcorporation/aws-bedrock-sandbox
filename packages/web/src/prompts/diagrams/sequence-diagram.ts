Sequence Diagram Syntax
Syntax
Participants
Participants can be defined implicitly as in the first example on this page. Participants or actors are drawn in the order they appear in the source text of the diagram. However, there may be times when you want to display participants in a different order than their appearance in the first message. You can explicitly specify the order of appearance of actors as follows: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant Bob
    Bob->>Alice: Hello Alice
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob

Actors
If you want to use the actor symbol instead of a text-filled rectangle, you can use the actor statement as follows: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    actor Alice
    actor Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob

Aliases
Actors can be given convenient identifiers and descriptive labels.
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Alice
    participant J as John
    A->>J: Hello John, how are you?
    J->>A: Great!

Actor Creation and Destruction
You can create and destroy actors by messages. To do this, add the create or destroy directive before the message.
create participant B
A --> B: Hello

create directive supports actor/participant distinction and aliases. You can destroy the sender or receiver of a message, but you can only create a receiver.
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob->>Alice: Great!
    create participant Carl
    Alice->>Carl: Hi Carl!
    create actor Donald
    Carl->>Donald: Hi!
    destroy Carl
    Alice-xBob: Too many, delete
    destroy Bob
    Bob->>Alice: Agree

Grouping / Box
You can group actors into vertical boxes. Use the following syntax to define the color (transparent if not specified) and descriptive label: 
Code: 
box Aqua Group Description
... actors ...
end
box Group without description
... actors ...
end
box rgb(33,66,99)
... actors ...
end
box rgba(33,66,99,0.5)
... actors ...
end

Note: 
If the group name is a color name, you can force the color to be transparent: 
Code: 
box transparent Aqua
... actors ...
end

Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    box Purple Alice & John
    participant A
    participant J
    end
    box Different group
    participant B
    participant C
    end
    A->>J: John, how are you?
    J->>A: Great!
    A->>B: Bob, how is Charlie?
    B->>C: Hey Charlie, how are you?

Messages
Messages can be displayed as solid or dotted lines: 
Code: 
[Actor][Arrow][Actor]:Message text
Currently supported 10 types of arrows: 
Type      Description
->       No arrow solid line
-->      No arrow dotted line
->>      Arrowed solid line
-->>     Arrowed dotted line
<<->>    Double arrowed solid line (v11.0.0 and later)
<<-->>   Double arrowed dotted line (v11.0.0 and later)
-x       Solid line with a cross at the end
--x      Solid line with a cross at the end
-)       Solid line with an open arrow at the end (asynchronous)
--)      Dotted line with an open arrow at the end (asynchronous)

Activations
Actors can be activated and deactivated. Activation (and deactivation) can be done as a dedicated declaration: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    activate John
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    deactivate John

You can also use the +/- suffix to the arrow of a message to create a shortcut notation: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>-Alice: Great!

You can activate the same actor multiple times: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Great!
    John-->>-Alice: I'm fine, thanks!

Notes
You can add notes to a sequence diagram. This is done using the following syntax: 
Note [ right of | left of | over ] [Actor]: Note text
You can choose between right of, left of, or over.
See the example below: 
sequenceDiagram
    participant John
    Note right of John: Text in note

You can also create notes that span two participants: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    Note over Alice,John: General interaction

Line breaks
You can add line breaks to a sequence diagram: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->John: Hello John, <br/>how are you?
    Note over Alice,John: Common interaction, <br/>but displayed on two lines.

Loops
You can represent loops in a sequence diagram: 
loop Loop text
... statements ...
end
See the example below: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->John: Hello John, how are you?
    loop Every minute
        John-->Alice: I'm fine, thanks!
    end

Alt
You can represent alternative paths in a sequence diagram: 
alt Describing text
... statements ...
else
... statements ...
end
You can also use the optional sequence (if without else): 
opt Describing text
... statements ...
end
See the example below: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    alt If something is bad
        Bob->>Alice: I'm not very good... :(
    else If something is good
        Bob->>Alice: I'm very fine!
    end
    opt Additional response
        Bob->>Alice: Thank you for caring
    end

Parallel
You can display actions that occur in parallel (concurrently): 
Code: 
par [Action 1]
... statements ...
and [Action 2]
... statements ...
and [Action N]
... statements ...
end
See the example below: 
sequenceDiagram
    par Alice to Bob
        Alice->>Bob: Hello everyone!
    and Alice to John
        Alice->>John: Hello everyone!
    end
    Bob-->>Alice: Hello Alice!
    John-->>Alice: Hello Alice!

You can also nest parallel blocks: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    par Alice to Bob
        Alice->>Bob: Help John
    and Alice to John
        Alice->>John: I would like to finish it by today
        par John to Charlie
            John->>Charlie: Can you finish it by today?
        and John to Diana
            John->>Diana: Can you help me by today?
        end
    end

Critical Region
You can display actions that must be performed under certain conditions: 
Code: 
critical [Action that must be performed]
... statements ...
option [Circumstance A]
... statements ...
option [Circumstance B]
... statements ...
end
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    critical DB connection
        Service-->DB: Connect
    option Network timeout
        Service-->Service: Log error
    option Authentication denied
        Service-->Service: Log another error
    end

You can also create a critical block without options: 
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    critical DB connection
        Service-->DB: Connect
    end
This critical block can also be nested (nested) like the previous par statement.

Break
You can display the stop of a sequence in the flow (usually used when modeling exceptions).
This can be done using the following syntax: 
break [something happened]
... statements ...
end
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    User-->API: Something
    API-->Reservation service: Start reservation process
    break Reservation process failed
        API-->User: Display failure
    end
    API-->Billing service: Start billing process

Background Highlighting
You can highlight the flow by providing a colored background rectangle. This can be done using the following syntax: 
rect COLOR
... content ...
end
The color is defined using rgb and rgba syntax.
rect rgb(0, 255, 0)
... content ...
end

rect rgba(0, 0, 255, .1)
... content ...
end
Code: 
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant John

    rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
    note right of Alice: Alice calls John
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, are you okay?
    rect rgb(200, 150, 255)
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Yes, I can hear you!
    end
    John-->>-Alice: I'm very fine!
    end
    Alice->>+John: Do you want to go to the game tonight?
    John-->>-Alice: Yes, I'll meet you there.

Comments
You can enter comments into a sequence diagram, which are ignored by the parser. Comments must be on a separate line and must start with %% (double percent sign). The text from the start of the comment to the next line break will be treated as a comment, including the diagram syntax.
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, are you okay?
    %% This is a comment
    John-->>Alice: Yes, I'm fine!

Entity codes to escape characters
You can use the following syntax to escape characters:
sequenceDiagram
    A->>B: I #9829; you!
    B->>A: I #9829; you #infin; times more!

Numbers are specified in decimal, and # can be encoded as #35; . HTML character names are also supported.
Semicolons can be used to define line breaks instead of line breaks, so you need to use #59; when including a semicolon in the message text.

Actor Menus
Actors can have popup menus with individual links to external pages. For example, if an actor represents a web service, useful links might include the service's health dashboard, the repository containing the service's code, and the Wiki page describing the service.
This can be done by adding one or more link lines in the following format: 
link <actor>: <link-label> @ <link-url>

Example:
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant John
    link Alice: Dashboard @ https://dashboard.contoso.com/alice
    link Alice: Wiki @ https://wiki.contoso.com/alice
    link John: Dashboard @ https://dashboard.contoso.com/john
    link John: Wiki @ https://wiki.contoso.com/john
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Yes, I'm fine!
    Alice-)John: See you later!

Advanced Menu Syntax
There is an advanced syntax that depends on the JSON format. If you are familiar with the JSON format, you can also use the following method: 
This can be done by adding link lines in the following format: 
links <actor>: <json-formatted link-name link-url pairs>

sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant John
    links Alice: {"Dashboard": "https://dashboard.contoso.com/alice", "Wiki": "https://wiki.contoso.com/alice"}
    links John: {"Dashboard": "https://dashboard.contoso.com/john", "Wiki": "https://wiki.contoso.com/john"}
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Yes, I'm fine!
    Alice-)John: See you later!

Implementation Example: 
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
    Alice-)John: See you later!

Note: 
For nodes, the word "end" can break the diagram due to the script nature of the mermaid language.
If you cannot avoid using it, you need to enclose it in one of the following: 
- Parentheses () : (end)
- Quotes "" : "end"
- Braces {} : {end}
- Square brackets [] : [end]

Implementation Example 2:
sequenceDiagram
    actor User as User
    participant Web as Web Application
    participant Stock as Inventory Management System
    participant Payment as Payment System
    participant Order as Order Management System

    User->>Web: Select items
    
    critical Inventory check processing
        Web->>Stock: Check inventory status
        Stock-->>Web: Inventory status response
        alt No stock
            Web-->>User: Out of stock notification
        end
    end

    User->>Web: Add to cart
    Web-->>User: Cart addition complete notification
    User->>Web: Enter order information
    Web-->>User: Order content confirmation display

    critical Payment and inventory check processing
        Web->>Payment: Start payment processing
        alt Payment failed
            Payment-->>Web: Payment error
            Web-->>User: Payment failure notification
        else Payment successful
            Payment-->>Web: Payment complete notification
            par Inventory check and order processing
                Web->>Stock: Inventory check request
                Stock-->>Web: Inventory check complete
                Web->>Order: Order registration
                Order-->>Web: Order registration complete
            end
            Web-->>User: Order complete notification
        end
    end

    par Post-processing of each system
        Web-)Stock: Inventory update
        Web-)Order: Delivery arrangement request
        Web-)Payment: Sales confirmation processing
    end

    Note over Web,Order: Post-processing completed asynchronously
